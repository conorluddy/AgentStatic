    <h1>About Nimbus</h1>
    <p>We believe storing and sharing files should be effortless.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Nimbus was founded with a simple goal: make cloud storage that doesn't get in the way. No complicated folder hierarchies. No confusing sharing settings. Just a place to put your files and share them with your team.</p>

      <p>We've been there—wrestling with clunky enterprise software, hitting storage limits at the worst times, losing track of which version of a file is current. We built Nimbus to solve those problems.</p>

      <h2>What We Believe</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Simplicity wins</strong> — Features should be discoverable, not buried in menus</li>
        <li><strong>Security is non-negotiable</strong> — Your files deserve bank-level protection</li>
        <li><strong>Speed matters</strong> — Uploads, downloads, and sync should feel instant</li>
        <li><strong>Fair pricing</strong> — No surprise charges, no artificial limits</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Team</h2>
      <p>We're a small team of engineers and designers who've worked at companies you've heard of—and grew frustrated with the tools we were forced to use. Now we're building the file storage solution we always wanted.</p>

      <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
