title: Welcome to Your New Site
description: Your first blog post - customize this for your own content
date: 2025-01-15

This is a sample blog post. You can write content in Markdown, and it will be converted to HTML during the build.

## Getting Started

To customize this blog:

1. Edit or delete the sample posts in `pages/blog/`
2. Create new `.md` files with frontmatter (title, description, date)
3. Run `npm run build` to regenerate the site

## Frontmatter

Every blog post needs frontmatter at the top:

```yaml
---
title: Your Post Title
description: A short description for listings and SEO
date: 2025-01-15
---
```

The date determines the sort order on the blog listing page—newest posts appear first.

## Markdown Features

You can use all standard Markdown:

- **Bold** and *italic* text
- [Links](https://example.com)
- `inline code`
- Lists (like this one)

```javascript
// Code blocks with syntax highlighting
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Next Steps

Replace this post with your own content. Check out the other sample posts for more examples.
