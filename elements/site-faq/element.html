  <details>
    <summary>Why no JavaScript?</summary>
    <p>Most landing pages don't need JavaScript. Removing it makes sites faster, more accessible, and easier to host.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do custom elements work without registration?</summary>
    <p>Browsers render unknown elements as inline by default. We use CSS to style them as block, grid, or flex. No JavaScript needed.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can I add JavaScript for interactivity?</summary>
    <p>Absolutely! The build system doesn't prevent JavaScript. Add it when you need progressive enhancement.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What about dark mode?</summary>
    <p>Dark mode is built-in using CSS custom properties and the prefers-color-scheme media query.</p>
