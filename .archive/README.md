# Archive - Historical Planning Documentation

This directory contains the original planning documentation that has been consolidated into `/FINALPLAN/`.

These documents are preserved for historical reference but **should not be used for active development**.

## What's Here

### `/PLANNING/` - Original Comprehensive Planning
The original 7-phase planning documents including:
- Phase documents (Phase 0-7)
- Component matrix
- Roadmap
- Various navigation and summary documents

These have been **consolidated and improved** in `/FINALPLAN/`.

### `/architecture/` - Technical Specifications
Original technical architecture documents covering:
- AST schema
- Validation systems
- MCP integration
- Build system
- Documentation system

These have been **merged into FINALPLAN pillar documents**.

## Use FINALPLAN Instead

For active development, always refer to:
- **`/FINALPLAN/README.md`** - Planning navigation
- **`/FINALPLAN/PILLAR-*/`** - Implementation by pillar
- **`/FINALPLAN/ROADMAP.md`** - Timeline and dependencies

## Historical Value

These archived documents are valuable for:
- Understanding the evolution of the plan
- Seeing detailed justifications for decisions
- Referencing decision history

But for **implementation**, use FINALPLAN.
