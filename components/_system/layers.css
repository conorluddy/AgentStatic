/**
 * CASCADE LAYER DEFINITIONS
 *
 * Purpose: Establishes the cascade layer order for predictable specificity management.
 * This file MUST be imported first before any other styles.
 *
 * Layer Hierarchy (from lowest to highest specificity):
 * 1. reset     - Browser normalization (lowest priority)
 * 2. base      - Element defaults (html, body, headings, etc.)
 * 3. components - Component styles (all component CSS)
 * 4. utilities - Helper classes (margin, text alignment, etc.)
 * 5. overrides - User customizations (highest priority)
 *
 * Why Cascade Layers?
 * - Eliminates specificity battles
 * - Makes CSS more predictable and maintainable
 * - Enables component-scoped naming without BEM verbosity
 * - Provides natural isolation between different style concerns
 *
 * Browser Support: All modern evergreen browsers support @layer
 * (Chrome 99+, Firefox 97+, Safari 15.4+, Edge 99+)
 *
 * Usage:
 * Import this file first in your main CSS entry point:
 * @import './components/_system/layers.css';
 * @import './components/_system/reset.css';
 * @import './components/_system/base.css';
 */
